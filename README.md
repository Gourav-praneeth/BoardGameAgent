# Board Game Agent
This project implements a Board Game Agent that leverages retrieval and preprocessing techniques to assist with gameplay, strategy, and knowledge-based reasoning for board games. It provides a modular structure to preprocess game data, retrieve relevant knowledge, and run an interactive application.

## Project Structure
### app.py
The main entry point for the application. It integrates preprocessing and retrieval modules, and provides the interactive agent functionality.

### preprocess.py
Handles data preprocessing tasks, such as cleaning, structuring, and preparing board game knowledge for use by the retriever.

### retriever.py
Implements the retrieval logic, enabling the agent to fetch relevant knowledge or strategies when responding to queries.
